      Soon enough. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I usually try to keep my
      sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
      Hey, guess what you're accessories to. There's one way and only one way to
      determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! No, of course
      not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical
      violence never solved anything. Take me to your leader! But existing is
      basically all I do! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your
      testimony? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you
      think? I wish! It's a nickel. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
      Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive
      decompression! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
      So, how 'bout them Knicks? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your
      poop. Hey, whatcha watching? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! But,
      like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. You guys
      aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
      No argument here. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel
      love! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then
      perhaps gifts! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were
      there, and you were there, and you were there! We can't compete with Mom!
      Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I'm Santa Claus!
      Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
      Bender, quit destroying the universe! Yes, I saw. You were doing well,
      until everyone died. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler,
      who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Yeah.
      Give a little credit to our public schools. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Ooh,
      name it after me! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back
      there and change your opinions manually! I am the man with no name, Zapp
      Brannigan! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you
      say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. And why did
      'I' have to take a cab? You can see how I lived before I met you. And yet
      you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Oh
      Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who
      ever loved me. It doesn't look so shiny to me. File not found. Can I use
      the gun? Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Shut up and take my
      money! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it
      turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't
      not do it! Really?! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we
      really have the pure strength of 'will'? It may comfort you to know that
      Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that
      it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused
      him to empty his bowels. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look
      for more stuff to steal! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Oh, I
      always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his
      legs? It doesn't look so shiny to me. We'll need to have a look inside you
      with this camera. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy
      world of plot holes and spelling errors! You're going to do his laundry?
      Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride
      the bumper cars. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal
      parasites? Tell her she looks thin. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no
      choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception
      isn't very… If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't
      wanna be right. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot
      how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. I'm Santa
